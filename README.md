# Multivariable-Feedback-Control
This project encompasses designing controllers for both single and double degrees of freedom (1DOF and 2DOF) systems. It involves analyzing the transient response and sensitivity functions, evaluating closed-loop performance, and studying singular value decompositions in both minimum phase and non-minimum phase systems. Additionally, robust stability analysis of the system is conducted to ensure its resilience against uncertainties.
